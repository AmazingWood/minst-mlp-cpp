# minst-mlp-cpp
A two layers multiple layers pereptron.  
I transport it from python to c++.  
It just prove that C++ can do machine/deep learning better than python.  
U can download the python version on https://www.ituring.com.cn/book/1921  
And here's another version which is from my best friend: https://github.com/EternalSaga/simple-two-layers-mlp  
He is really a master in this kind of staff.
